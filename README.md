## C-FORS BFO Session
This four-day summer school aims to give both a theoretical and a practical overview  of foundational ontologies. It focuses on four of them, devoting one full day to each: Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO, Tuesday 20 May), Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE, Wednesday 21 May), Basic Formal Ontology (BFO, Thursday 22 May), and Business Objects Reference Ontology (BORO, Friday 23 May). Each day is divided into two sessions. In the morning sessions, invited speakers will give a theoretical introduction to the ontology. The afternoon sessions will consist of practical group work on case studies that will help participants understand how to apply the ontology. At the end of these sessions, invited speakers will discuss the case studies engaging with participantsâ€™ group work.

This repository is devoted to the Thursday 22 May BFO Tutorial session led by [John Beverley](https:johnbeverley.com)
